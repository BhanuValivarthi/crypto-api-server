Hi Sir,Mam
   I am Bhanu Prakash,

   For the above assignment
   given I implementded Task1,Task2,Task3 successfully

   The real Challenge i faced in 4th task where to create to another server for work-server and connect with a medium redis.I think it will take some more time to complete.
   So I instead create a another function sechdule.js in api-server and it will update the storecryptostats() in every 15 minutes.

   I used a mongodb atlas for database storage and I generate a public url by pushing the code in render.

  This are the example URL for the cryptocoin data :
  1.https://crypto-api-server-gmqv.onrender.com/deviation?coin=bitcoin
  2.https://crypto-api-server-gmqv.onrender.com/stats?coin=bitcoin
